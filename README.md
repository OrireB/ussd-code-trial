# USSD Banking Simulator (Python Basics Project)

This is a beginner-friendly Python project that simulates a basic USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) banking interface, similar to what youâ€™d see when dialing a code like `*123#` on a mobile phone. It mimics real-life banking operations through a command-line interface, providing a practical learning experience for those starting with Python.

## Features

- Simulated USSD menu navigation
- Account balance inquiry
- Money transfer simulation
- Airtime purchase
- Simple PIN authentication (optional)
- Menu return and session exit options
